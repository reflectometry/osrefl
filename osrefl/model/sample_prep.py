class Unit_Cell(object):
    '''
    **Overview:**

        Contains the information for the processed unit cell information. This
        class makes the implementation of scattering calculations easier by by
        creating one structure that only contains information necessary for the
        theory function calculation, regardless of how that information was
        obtained.


    **Producer Classes:**


    *GeomUnit*

    Uses geometric shape parameters to calculate the discretized unit cell.
    Magnetic support is included in the form of a unit cell which contains the
    magnetic SLD values.


    *OOMMFUnit*

    Uses the .omf output format produced by the Object Oriented MicroMagnetic
    Framework software. to created both
    the structure and magnetic scattering arrays. The Unit_Cell objected created
    by this class will contain the structural SLD as well as a list of arrays
    which contain the x,y, and z magnetic components. This can be used by the
    magnetic approximations to calculated the four magnetic cross- sections.


    *K3DUnit*

    Loads a raw data fill which is exported by the k3d modeling software `K-3D
    software <http://www.k-3d.org/>`_. This type of creation does not support
    magnetic representations.


    *GrayImgUnit*

    Loads a .png image and turns it into a 3D SLD array. It extends the image in
    the y direction where the sensitivity to scattering is low.

    **Parameters:**

            Sometimes, the .png file is much higher in resolution than is needed

          with the scattering length density values of the profile.

        * When loading the image, it assumes that the image is a three channel

        **Parameters:**

            *Dxyz:* (float,[3]|angstroms)

                The real space length, width and height represented by the
                image. Because it is assumed that the image is the x z
                direction, the Dxyz[1] or Dy is meaningless here. It is left in
                only to allow for the consistency of Dxyz.


            *scale:* (float|factor)

                This parameter allows the user to uniformly scale the image
                values by a factor. This is to allow for directly scaling the
                image to SLD values.


        .. Note::
            * The user should be allowed to choose the axes on the image.

          create a 2D image that OOMMF then calculates the minimized magnetic
          character for. The results are assumed to be consistent through the

class GeomUnit(object):

    '''
    **Overview:**

        This is a producer of a Unit_Cell object. Given a Scene of Shape objects
        and other key parameters (defined below), this class will render a three
        dimensional numpy array of the SLD of the unit cell along with the
        magnetic SLD in the case the it is defined.


    **Parameters:**

        *Dxyz:* (float,[3])|(angstroms)
            The x,y and z real space size of the unit cell.

        *n:* (int,[3]|(count)
            The number of elements the x, y and z axis of the unit cell will be
            divided into. This is how course/fine the unit cell is discretized
            into.

        *scene:* (Scene)
            A scene object which holds the collection of shapes to be rendered
            into the unit cell. The renderer renders shapes in the order they
            are provided. Multiple shape are rendered by only filling unit cell
            array values where they have not yet been changed by previous
            shapes. For example, in the case of a core/shell scenario, the
            shapes should be listed so that the core is listed before the shell.

        *inc_sub:* (float,[2]|)
            [SLD of incident media,SLD of Substrate]. This holds the scattering
            length density for the incident and substrate media respectively.
            The attribute does not currently hold the neutron absorption of the
            materials which is negligible.


    **Parameters(Class):**

        *value_list:* (float,(3)|angstroms)

            This is a list of arrays for the x,y and z directions. Each array
            contains the real space distance of the array element from the
            origin. (eg. for 4 points at a step size of .2 angstroms in the x
            direction, value_list[0] = array([0,0.2,0.4,0.6])

        *unit:* (float:3D array| angstroms^2)

            This is the discretized representation of the structural unit cell.
            This is the array for which the scattering is calculated.

        *mag_unit:* (float:3D array|angstroms^2)

            This is the discretized representation of the magnetic unit cell.
            This is for the case of unpolarized neutrons where a value is given
            for the magnetic SLD which differs from the structural SLD.

        *step:* (float:[3]|angstroms)

            This is the reals space step size for the unit cell in the x, y and
            z direction. It is the total real space increment that a single
            array value represents.


    .. Note::
        * The renderer uses the mathematical formulas provided in the
          calculation.py file for each shape class to determine if each point in
          the 3D array falls within the shape.
        * If Dxyz[2] is not defined, the class chooses a value that
          will end just above the top of the tallest feature in the unit cell
          (adds approximately one layer of incident media).
        * Currently, the x,y and z values represent the real space value at
          the beginning of the discretized unit rather than the value of the
          unit at  the center. This must be revised.

            can lead to mismatch in intensities between the negative and
            positive qx diffraction peaks.

    **Overview:**

        Holds all of the information for the q-space output for which the

        make access to information about the scattering easier.


    **Parameters(__init__):**

        *minimums:* (float,[3]|angstroms)
            The minimum q values that the user would like solved. The data is in
            the form: [minimum x, minimum y, minimum z]

        *maximums:* (float,[3]|angstroms)
            The maximums q values that the user would like solved. The data is
            in the form: [maximums x, maximums y, maximums z]

        *points:* (float,[3]|angstroms)
            The number of points that the user would like the provided q space
            (defined by the minimums and maximums) split into. The data is in
            the form: [x points,y points,z points]


    **Parameters(Class):**

        *q_step:* (float,[3]|angstroms^-1)
            The reciprocal space step size for the x,y and z dimensions.

            The total list of values being solved for in the x, y and z
            directions.

        *q_refract:* (float,[array]|angstroms^-1)
            When the neutron beam is transmitted through a substrate, the beam
            refracts, altering the effective qx value. This is recorded in this
            variable. Its value is dependent on the ki and ko values for a
            specific qx,qy, qz combination.
